        <description>From August, github removed the use of authentication for https when using git.
If you had cloned repositories using https rather than ssh you will have issues with pulling and pushing to github.
For documentation about how to change to using ssh to authenticate with github please see https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh
Once set up, you will then need to either re-clone the repositories (possibly the easiest method), or go through each repository on your computer and update the remotes so they use ssh rather than https.</description>

        <description>Intro Once you have finished Software Carpentry Git lesson, you should be able to do basic version controlling with Git. You would have learnt how to:
 Stage and commit your changes Make a remote GitHub repository Push and pull from your remote repository Solve merge conflicts  These skills are enough for you to get started with tracking and maintaining your own project, but once you start collaborating with others, you can run into trouble really quick.</description>
