        <description>Using Conda on the server # Make conda available # latest version installed at time of post module load miniconda/Miniconda3_4.8.3 Conda environments Conda is a package manager that can make running software that requires specific versions of software easier to install and manage.
Essentially, conda lets you define an environment with all the dependencies of the software taken care of and then when you want to use the software, you load the environment.</description>

        <title>Adding Annotations to VCFs</title>
        <link>https://merrimanlab.github.io/post/2021-09-21-vcf-annotation/</link>

        <description>The main consideration is to make sure that the reference resource matches the genomic build of your VCF. i.e. make sure you are using GRCh37 resources for a GRCh37 aligned VCF, or GRCh38 resources for a GRCh38 aligned VCF.
dbSNP A vcf from dbSNP can be used to annotate rsIDs into the ID column of a vcf. For instance the dbSNP v151 VCF can be downloaded here ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/snp/organisms/human_9606_b151_GRCh37p13/VCF/ - one key thing is make sure that you use the same genome build as your VCF that you want to annotate.</description>

        <description>example.vcf.gz is a VCF file of three human subjects aligned to GRCh37 and varaint called following the GATK best practices that had been annotated with rsIDs from dbSNP v151 and further annotated using dbNSFP4.0a and snpEff so includes annotations such as:
 Allele Frequencies for variants from public databases 1000 Genomes, ExACm gnomad, etc functional annotations: missense, intron, 3&#39;/5&#39; UTR, etc gene names  In order to create it refer to the adding VCF annotations howto</description>

        <description>Merrimanlab Remote Working VPN access Credentials to use are your email/webkiosk
How to Install VPN:
Download Cisco AnyConnect from here: https://www.otago.ac.nz/its/services/network/otago038027.html
New process: https://otago.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/2113
After you&amp;rsquo;ve gone through this process every time you want your home internet to pretend it is at uni open Cisco AnyConnect &amp;amp; tell it to connect to UO-VPN-SSL, then just use your internet like usual.
For students we will have to request your username be allowed VPN access, dependent on whether the uni devises another acceptable way for you to access our servers.</description>
