Great!
You can write it for us!
Follow the instructions below to get you started on your journey to write your first post.

Or alternatively, you can create an issue (but not recommended).

## How to contribute

### How to make a post

We recommend you to generate a skeleton (R)markdown file via R/RStudio (`blogdown::new_post()` function) or Hugo (`hugo new <post_name>.md`).

### Where do I put my post?

Once you have finished writing your post, make sure to set `draft: false` in the header (if it exists) and save it in one of the two places in this repository:
1. In the `draft` directory, where it will be moved to appropriate directory after merging
1. In the correct directory in the `content` directory, if you know where to put it
